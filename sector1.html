          <h4>Since learning is all about what the student produces, then the student is the center of the whole teaching experience. Because teaching is guiding the student to learn, the characteristics of the student himself are paramount. Before we explore aspects of education that deal with lectures or homework or classrooms or textbooks, we've got to focus in on the fundamental principles with regard to the students themselves. We will divide these characteristics up into two categories. </h4>

          <h4>The two major divisions are <span class="important">the affective domain</span> and the <span class="important">cognitive domain.</span> The cognitive domain of learning is what a student processes in the brain. It is all about what she is thinking. The affective domain, on the other hand, is what a student feels, whether she dislikes or loves something, what she wants …or wants to avoid.</h4>

          <h4>In the affective domain of the student, right down in the heart where the feelings and attitudes live, is where we will find our first overarching principle of education. Principle number one is, <span class="important">“If there is an increase in the level of student motivation and commitment to learn, then learning will increase.”</span> To illustrate the importance of this principle, we must first refer back to the definitions of teaching and learning. Learning is producing. It is an act of agency by the student. If the students do not have the motivation to actually do the activities that will help them to produce that knowledge, then the learning can’t happen. </h4>

          <h4>There is a legend that a man came to Socrates and asked to be taught. Socrates responded by dunking the man in the ocean and holding his head under water. When he finally let the man up, Socrates asked him what he most wanted when his head was under water. As you can imagine, the response came back, “Air. I wanted air.” Socrates then gave this great foundational principle to learning. “When you want wisdom and learning as badly as you wanted air, then you shall have it.”</h4>

          <h4>Now, think of your own personal experiences. Have you ever had someone try to teach you something that you didn’t have very much motivation to learn?</h4>

          <h4>What does this mean for us as teachers or tutors? Is a student’s motivation to learn simply out of our control? What about your favorite teachers? Did they inspire in you a higher motivation to learn? Of course they did. While it is true that it is not completely in our control, we do have some influence on the feelings and motivation of our students. From the doctrine of the LDS Church comes one of the best summaries of how this plays out for students and teachers. It says the teacher and the student both “are uplifted and edified and rejoice together.” Think of how you can help share the excitement of what you have learned, how to make it come alive for them, and how to help them feel praised and encouraged for what they accomplish.</h4>

          <h4>In addition to motivation, students will also need to have the commitment to act on their good intentions. You can help them follow through on their motivation by meeting with them, following up on their assignments, and asking how they have been doing in preparing for upcoming quizzes and tests. That will help them to stick with the commitments to learning that may not be fulfilled if they’re left alone. Now, remember this motivation and commitment we are talking about are characteristics of the students. It is not your responsibility to ensure that they have them, but certainly if they don't have it, there is a limit to what they will be able to learn. Encouraging and inspiring that motivation will be key to you being able to be a better teacher.</h4>

          <h4>One of the most common sources of discouragement for math students is when they feel completely lost—the instructor or book is flying right over their heads. The basis for this idea was articulated many decades ago by a Russian psychologist, Lev Vygotsky. He introduced the concept of a <span class="important">“Zone of Proximal Development.”</span> He grouped tasks into three categories: those a student is able to do without assistance, those he can do with assistance, and those that are beyond his ability to do even with assistance. The Zone of Proximal Development (or ZPD) is the grouping where students are able to complete the task with some assistance and teaching.</h4>

          <h4>Busy work and boredom live in the lowest category, while overly difficult things that give feelings of discouragement and being lost live in the top category. When things are in the middle zone, the ZPD, learning is exciting and wonderful.</h4>

          <h4>Let's move to the cognitive aspect of student learning. Remember, this deals with the part of the student that thinks. Consider what the student needs, cognitively, in order to learn. There certainly must be a minimum level of ability. Trying to get a shoe to tie itself would be useless primarily because of the lack of cognitive ability. When you first started learning math, if you didn't have the ability to comprehend abstract concepts such as variables, slope, or unknowns, then you wouldn't be able to learn it very well. Students must have the capacity or potential to learn what is intended. </h4>

          <h4>In addition to ability, there must exist a certain level of preparation for learning, and that is actually really important. I want you to think about the things that you have learned, such as tying your shoelaces. If you didn't have the hand-eye coordination that’s required, you couldn't do it. Similarly, learning to tie your shoe created within you a higher level of preparation for you to learn even more, such as learning to tie an apron or wrap a Christmas present.</h4>

          <h4>As a tutor or teacher, the preparation that a student has may not be completely within your control. His preparation is the end effect of all previous learning experiences leading up to his current situation. On a small scale, you can certainly help students to become prepared for what they are going to learn in the next class or on the next assignment by activating or securing background knowledge or skills before you intend to teach them something. On the other hand, the learning that students do with you now will add to their ability and preparation for future learning, for either good or ill. Let’s dive deeper into these ideas of ability and preparation of the student and how crucial they are to learning. </h4>

          <h4>We already spoke of the ZPD and the effect it can have on the motivation of a student, but notice that there is an inherent connection to what we’ve said about ability and preparation. If a student doesn’t have enough background related to what he is trying to learn, then not only will his motivation be diminished, but his ability to learn is severely impaired. He can’t reach his goal, and can’t hope to, without help to fill in what he is missing. One of the most satisfying parts of teaching is to know what level a student needs to get to, find out where he really is and what he understands, and then slowly help him step from one level to the next until he has discovered and produced what he needed to, and he knows he has done it. It is so fulfilling. </h4>
