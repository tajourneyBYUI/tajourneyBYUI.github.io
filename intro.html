          <h4>
            Welcome, tutors, teachers, and all interested in learning. We are about to embark on a discovery of cool, powerful, and far-reaching principles of math education. Before we start this journey, we need to properly prepare by leveraging and combining the strengths of these two major fields of study. First, Mathematics: crisp, clear, precise, and logic-based. And, second, Education: uplifting, personalized, dynamic, and engaging.
          </h4>
          <h4>
            What do mathematicians love? They tend to enjoy the rigor, clarity, and definite nature of being able to find solutions to problems. They spend their time in analysis of issues and situations. There are rules and procedures that, if followed, give a predictable outcome. These have been proven through deductive logic and countless generations of application and are constant, stable, and immutable. Mathematicians love truth.
          </h4>
          <h4>
            Those who study to become teachers through the field of education tend to focus on conditions that open for others the doors of learning. Their focus is on interpersonal relationships and motivation. They love to see the eyes of their students light up when understanding occurs, and they are kept energized by the ever-changing needs of the individuals they serve. They enjoy studying methods and skills that enhance growth in others, and they find fulfillment in lighting the fire of learning. Educators love impacting students.

            Though these two disciplines are complementary, sometimes professionals in these two disciplines will be at odds with each other. The uncertain, individualized nature of education and the impersonal, aloof side of math will occasionally draw ire from the other group.
          </h4>
          <h4>
            A conversation many years ago about math versus education elicited from an education department chair the statement, “What good is all of the knowledge in the world if you can’t share it with someone?” From a mathematics department chair, in a related conversation, came the quote, “Those educators can pontificate all day long about how to teach integration but can’t even take the integral of one over x dx.” Sometimes they just don’t respect the strengths of the other.

            When a mathematician takes all of the tools of analysis he has developed through years of study and discipline and combines them with the desire to engage and help even the most struggling students, the result is amazing. We will take the attitude of the optimistic mathematician—there exists a set of truths and ideals that guide the improvement of education. We recognize the fact that students are individuals and that teaching is not an exact science, but we also believe that there do exist principles that don’t change—that there is an ideal by which teachers can measure their growth. A great educator and administrator, Boyd K. Packer, illustrated the existence of such an ideal and said:
          </h4>
          <h4>
            "Now, in the very saying of 'there is too much' or 'too little,' or “he is too something” or “not enough of something,” there is the implication that somewhere there is just enough—that somewhere there is just the right amount of whatever we are talking about. And so the teacher I would like to discuss with you is that teacher we carry in our minds—against whom all of you are measured by those of us who have the responsibility of appraising you. This teacher, of course, is the ideal teacher."
          </h4>
          <h4>
            In that sense, we will be discussing education, teaching, and learning in a very “mathy” manner. We will begin this journey with definitions and then build up a set of true principles of optimal and ideal education. Enjoy your trip!

          <h1>Definitions of Learning and Teaching
          <h4>
            With the background of where we are coming from and how we are going about establishing the true principles of education, we now begin our journey with laying down the most crucial context of all of our discussions. We start with a definition of the word “learn.” What does it mean to learn? Have you ever thought about that? Have you ever thought about how to define that word? Does it mean to understand? Or comprehend? Since our understanding of what learning is will form the basis for our entire discussion of education, this is one of most important topics we can possibly consider. Well, as you can imagine, educators for hundreds of years have talked about what it means to learn. This is actually a really complex question.
          </h4>
          <h4>
            Often we don't fully appreciate the value of an answer or solution until we fully understand the difficulty of the question. A professional, non-education organization, the Federal Aviation Administration, put together a handbook for pilots who have become instructors. They summarize several of the accepted definitions of learning from the field of Education.
          </h4>
          <ul>
            <li><h4>One definition is, “a change in behavior as a result of experience. It can be physical and overt or intellectual or attitudinal.” </h4></li>

            <li><h4>Another: “learning is a process by which experience brings about a relatively permanent change in behavior.” </h4></li>

            <li><h4>And, “the change in behavior that results from experience and practice.” </h4></li>

            <li><h4>Gaining knowledge. Look, they use the verb there. That's important. Developing. That's pretty good. </h4></li>

            <li><h4>The process of acquiring knowledge or skills through study experience or teaching. Notice this one has a lot of conditions on whether or not something has been learned. It is very interesting, and you'll notice it starts referring to behaviorism. As a small tangent, psychologists classify theories in education with labels such as behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism. There all sorts of “isms” out there on what people have thought of teaching and learning.</h4></li>

            <li><h4>Here’s cognition resulting from experience and directly influencing behavior. So, they are saying that if it doesn't directly influence behavior, they don't think it's learning.</h4></li>
          </ul>

        <!-- FIFTH PAGE  -->
        <div id="contentI-5">
          <h2>Page 5</h2>
          <h4>The purpose of seeing all of these is so you understand that in the field of Education, this is thought about quite a bit. Consider even the simple sentences of, “I've learned how to cook,” “I haven't learned Spanish,” or “That horse learned to jump the fence,” or “The dog learned to fetch a Frisbee.” Think about these and how difficult it might be to really communicate about education if we can't settle on what it actually means to learn. </h4>

          <h4>In upper level math classes, the most common beginnings of courses are definitions. Since we are basing some of what we are doing in the math world, we need the precision of a clear concept of what learning is to set the context for our entire journey through what makes ideal education.</h4>

          <h4>The definition we are going to use for the word learn is “to produce knowledge, skill, or a feeling that was not previously owned.” That’s it. Sounds simple, doesn’t it? This definition is broad enough to encompass the essential points of the varying definitions from all different branches of Education. It matches what we think of when we say, “animals learning tricks” and “teachers learning patience” and “students learning their multiplication tables.” The key is that learning doesn’t happen just when you understand or comprehend; it's when you can produce that knowledge. Some type of learning maybe physical, like learning how to shoot a free throw. </h4>

          <h4>Not only is the definition broad, it is functional enough to be accurately used by normal students and teachers and insightful enough to give direction to anyone who is interested in teaching. </h4>

          <h4>What is most important is focusing on the student as the person of action and attention in all education. In fact, taking as a definition of learning that students need to produce the material gives us the definition of teaching. To teach isn’t to present, organize, tell, demonstrate, or explain. It is “to guide another to learn.” Though all of those activities can help in teaching another person some knowledge or skill, they only result in actual teaching when learning, or the production of the knowledge, happens in the student. </h4>

          <h4>Think of some classical scenes of teachers or tutors doing things like lecturing, explaining, showing, demonstrating. With our definition of teaching, if students are disengaged, bored, distracted, or in any other way not producing the necessary or desired stuff, then teaching really isn’t happening. On the other hand, those same actions could very well be leading to great learning. The difference is the effect it has on the students.</h4>

          <h4>Articles that were considered revolutionary and incredibly insightful in higher education have been written about simply accepting this definition of teaching where the center of the action is the student instead of focusing on the actions of the instructors.</h4>

          <h4>We can think about this even with personal characteristics. When a person learns patience, charity, kindness, trustworthiness, or loyalty, it simply isn’t enough for a person to act in a certain way. They have only learned those character traits when those feelings are produced within them. </h4>

          <h4>This definition of learning and the subsequent corollary of teaching should be the foundation of everything teachers focus on. Similarly, tutors need to understand this because what they're supposed to be doing is helping others to learn. Teachers and tutors aren’t in their positions for themselves; they only succeed based on their influence on the creation of knowledge or skills in another. Teachers become more effective only if the students they are guiding learn more efficiently.</h4>

          <h4>At this point it would be quite understandable if you began to have large questions about how good teaching is even possible. If everything depends on what happens with the student, what can a teacher do? How can we even measure good teaching or talk about improving teaching? What impacts learning and how? With so many different things that could affect students and how they learn, can we ever get to an understanding of such a complex concept? These are the exact right questions to have. As we explore the principles of ideal teaching, those questions and more are what we will discuss.</h4>
